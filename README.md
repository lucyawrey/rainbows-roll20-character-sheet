## Rainbows Roll20 Character Sheet
This is an honestly awful implentation of an ASCII based character sheet for Roll20, an online tool for playing tabletop games. The origonal character sheet was made for a roleplaying game I designed called Rainbows and used an ASCII art style because it was easy to prototype and I found it pleasing. This worked well on paper, literally, but when I needed to convert it from text to HTML for use in Roll20 I was left with either essentially recreating it from scratch using a bunch of CSS to lay everythign out, or convert it to HTML the lazy way by replacing every space with a non breakable whitespace. That ended up working and the result is so awful I wanted to keep it.
