## Rainbows Roll20 Character Sheet
This is an honestly awful implementation of an ASCII based character sheet for Roll20.net, an online tool for playing tabletop games. The original character sheet was made for a roleplaying game called Rainbows (designed by my, Lucy Awrey) and used an ASCII art style because it was easy to prototype without needing to focus on deign at that stage. This worked well on paper, literally, but when I needed to convert it from text to HTML for use in Roll20 I was left with either essentially recreating it from scratch, or converting it to HTML the lazy way by replacing every space with a non breakable white space. That ended up working and the result is so awful I wanted to keep it.

# Installation
Create a custom character sheet for a campaign on Roll20, then copy and paste the HTML and CSS code into the Roll20 integrated editor. There is unfortunately not a better wey to do this.
